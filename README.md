# PizzaTowerGameSpecificData
This repository hosts a series of JSON files written for the `underanalyzer` branch of [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/tree/underanalyzer). It is intended to make Pizza Tower modding easier by correctly resolving assets. Collaboration is always appreciated, so feel free to open a pull request or two! :D

# How To Install
1. [Compile](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/blob/underanalyzer/README.md#compilation-instructions) the latest commit of UndertaleModTool from the `underanalyzer` branch.
2. In the folder containing the EXE, navigate to `GameSpecificData/Underanalyzer`.
3. Put in `pizzatower.json` from this repository.
4. Next, go back to the `GameSpecificData` folder and enter the `Definitions` folder.
5. Put in `pizzatowerdef.json` from this repository.
6. You're done! Launch UTMT (from your own compilation, of course) and the next time you open up Pizza Tower, the changes should be applied!

# Known Issues
- So far, I've really only gotten to about half of the content so far. It's helpful and mostly furfilling enough at the moment to release, however!
