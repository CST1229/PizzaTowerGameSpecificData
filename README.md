# PizzaTowerGameSpecificData
This repository hosts a series of JSON files written for the `underanalyzer` branch of [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/tree/underanalyzer). It is intended to make Pizza Tower modding easier by correctly resolving assets. Collaboration is always appreciated, so feel free to open a pull request or two! :D

# How To Install
1. [Download](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/releases/tag/bleeding-edge) the latest Bleedintg Edge version of UndertaleModTool.
2. Get a copy of this repository. I'd recommend using GitHub's ZIP download for easy install, but it's up to you how.
3. In the folder containing the UTMT build, merge the `GameSpecificData` folder from this repository into the one there.
4. You're done! Launch UTMT from there and the next time you open up Pizza Tower, the changes should be applied!

# Known Issues
- While progress is steady, it still isn't 100% there yet. It, however, should be useful enough to make basic mods with.
